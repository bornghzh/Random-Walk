# Random-Walk
A comprehensive Python-based project on random walk probability, addressing 38 questions (unfortunately, in Persian) and conducting 20 computer simulations. It explores 2D and 3D random walk concepts, offering in-depth analysis and visualization. Additionally, our report (using LaTeX) is in Persian.
